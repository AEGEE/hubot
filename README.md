## Hubot with slack adapter in Docker

Simple implementation, would recommend [https://github.com/minddocdev/hubot](https://github.com/minddocdev/hubot) for prod. 

I wanted one solution where I could commit the scripts instead of publishing them to NPM (and to play around it, and do it myself).

Does not let one select which scripts hubot can have, besides the default ones and the custom ones.

### Usage

- Add your own scripts to the `scripts` folder
- Set `.env` file accordingly
- `make`
- ???
- PROFIT!!!
